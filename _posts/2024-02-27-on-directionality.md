## On directionality

---

It seems that there's a quality of a person that has not yet been described extensively anywhere, yet its presence can be sensed.

This quality almost "defines" a person - their character, the way they talk, the way they act, and where they are going to be in the future. 

Have you ever talked to a person for 5 minutes and could already see where they are going to be soon or later in life? You can almost smell it, or feel the gravity of it, but you cannot describe how. 

Well, you guessed it - it's the person's directionality. It's the total vector of all the forces that have been and currently are influencing you, me, and everyone else on the planet. And all these forces combined produce the final directionality vector (and define its strength).

Some people have an enormously strong "vector". They are usually described as "radiating", "inspiring", "dedicated", "ambitious". When you talk to them you feel it as almost a heavy bullet train is passing by and your whole body feels its mass, power and speed. Inertia from it can even adjust your vector, but more on that later.

You have probably also talked to a bunch of boring people. It's even hard to understand why, but they just feel boring. Their life is boring, they are probably talking about vacations, places, parties, how they got SOOO drunk last time oh ma gawd.

Interesting people talk about it too, but for some reason they don't feel boring.I'm sure if Elon were to tell you a story or two about his romance with ***, you would listen even more carefully than to his lecture about rockets.

You can say that context plays a major role. I would agree. Without knowing that Elon Musk is Elon Musk, would you listen to a story about a techo rave last weekend? But the thing about people with high directionality is that they will still make you feel the inertia if you give them a couple of minutes to talk.

So, how is this vector constructed? Well, forces differ from person to person. Of course, it all starts with the DNA and childhood. Unfortunate/fortunate mutations lead to certain developments of the body and brain, and the environment also adjusts our body's ability to transcript and then translate certain genes and develop, regulate metabolic processes etc.
But then you also get the environment not only in terms of food/water/air/gravity, but also in terms of information processing from available sensors (the content you consume from books, videos, other people, instagram reels or whatevs) - those are HUGE forces too. Your childhood traumas are forces that extend throughout your whole life, for example.

There are people whose forces are pulling into many directions, thus cancelling each other out and making their vector small (some people have a zero vector even because of this). Those people don't get anywhere. Not without some hugely influencing force, be it a traumatic experience, mentor, love or something else which gives them the direction. But the force has got to be strong and quite long in terms of time of the influence.

I had many examples of people who had a vector to become great at something, but then the other vector (usually connected with pleasure inducing activities such as alcohol/video games/sex/drugs) just straight up cancelled out their potential.

So what can we do about it? I think the first step is to recognise this and to try to think about it. Do you have directionality? Is it strong? Are you going anywhere, or are you circling around one point? 

Then, if you don't like something - fix it! You know the forces that influence you, or you'll learn about them at some point on an intellectual and spiritual level. Your friends/partner is holding you back? You are addicted to something? How can you get rid of some forces or add new ones? Is there a way to "spontaneously" create a force?

A couple of things that I've heard (and experienced a couple of them) which are working are simple things that everyone knows - surround yourself with great people. "Great" here means that they are high directional and their vectors point to the point where you want to get as well. As gravity and inertia pull mass to a certain point, you'll find that your vector is also going to adjust both your direction and the intensity of it. 

Directionality is deep. Concept like this is alike love - you can't describe it fully with words or with logic, you can only feel it. But by knowing that it exists, you can start adjusting your vector, so it points to a place where you want to be.
